This are some of the blender proyects I have made for fun :D

I should say that some of them were made following tutorials, but I am still proud of them and I still learned a lot from making every single one of them :)

I should also admit that these are not the only proyects I have started, as there are some other proyects that I left unfinished due to not enjoying them as much or not liking how they were turning out :/
